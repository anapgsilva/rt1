#rt1 - software to make and render molecular movie animations
rt1 is designed to make and render molecular movie animations. The software provides a framework allowing you to load and manipulate pdb files to easily generate movies. The software scales to generating and rendering scenes containing millions of atoms using GPUs to accelerate the rendering.

##Installation
###Prerequisites
- A Mac with a reasonable GPU (high-end iMac or Mac Pro) running macOS 10.9 or later

Just clone this repository and load the project in XCode. The initial configuration is an empty scene, but please look at the example code to get started.
